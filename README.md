Your client has requested you to design and develop a system in Java for their Computer Accessories
Shop. The aim is to facilitate various shopâ€™s activities in an efficient and practical manner. The starting
point for this project is a Javadoc documentation provided by the previous development team. This
documentation outlines some essential classes and interfaces that you must use to build the system.

However, you cannot modify these existing classes or interfaces by adding new methods, variables,
constructors, or making any other changes.
The shop sells two categories of product: keyboard and mouse. The different types of keyboard that
they sell are standard, flexible and gaming. The keyboards have the US layout or the UK layout. The
different types of mouse that they sell are standard and gaming. The mice may have different number
of buttons.

The system accommodates two user roles: admin and customer. The admin user has the right to add
a new product to the stock and view all products alongside their all attributes. On the other hand, 
customers have the ability to view all product details except for the original cost, search/filter products, add
items to their shopping basket, and complete their purchase using either PayPal or Credit Card. Credit
Card transactions require a 6-digit card number and a 3-digit security code, while PayPal transactions
require an email address. Additionally, customers should have the capability to cancel all items present
in their shopping basket.
